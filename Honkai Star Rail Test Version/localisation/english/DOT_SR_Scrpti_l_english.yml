DOT_SR.003.desc:0 "Gossip Changle day Xianju life edition" Xingli GUI November 13, author:Huai Min. On October 12, I met my old friend who had not been seen for two or three hundred years. Strange to say, I only remember that I had a word with him and decided not to talk to each other in this life. In the night, accidentally heard the voice of old friends, I will leave those old unhappiness behind... One hundred or two hundred years later, we were sitting at the same table, sipping tea and talking about tea. This is the kind of place where there are always some unexpected adventures. Scale Yuan spring a pot and a pot, and added a few times in the middle of the tea, unconsciously between, the taste of tea is faint, and the sky is getting late. The old friend was transferred to the cloud riding army in charge of ship equipment management, there are military discipline requirements, must return to the post on time. After exchanging contact information, we left reluctantly. On the way home, the shadows of the lights, I recalled a lot of experience with my old friends:together in Lingyun Bihai to learn to fly, I passed the pilot's license, and my old friends did not pass; In order to buy the latest "Lingrui" jade zhao, together to Chen Qi goods to do a long time of odd jobs... Friends who used to talk about everything can't talk for two or three hundred years because of a small thing they can't remember. If my old friends and I are not Xianzhou people, maybe less than 100 years old will die early, there will be no chance to get together. That would be a shame. Maybe it was too much tea, maybe it was too excited, lying in bed for a long time could not close my eyes, I became interested in wanting to swim at night. The sun and the moon are clearer than ever, so you can't miss it. One alone, but it is a pity, just my disciple did not fall asleep, I took him together in Changle night tour. Through the leisure court, into the deep grass path, it is an antique pavilion ruins, hidden in the deep grass, has not had time to clean up. The stones reflect a gentle white light as the moon caress them. An antique stone lion lying on its side on the grass, heaven and earth as the bed, sleepy, it seems to be sinking slowly in the deep pool of moonlight... My lover and I held our breath for fear of waking it. There are also lotus stone columns and moire flume knocked down here, almost no complete shape, it is a pity. Every time, there are always young people who put forward the retro trend, tossing out some ancient people's art. I think both I and these retro artists are afraid of the long time and always try to make the past no longer diluted in a nostalgic way, but all this will be powerless in the face of time. The mottled stone structures in the deep grass area seem to breathe. A distant voice said, "Don't try to understand, feel only tonight." I stopped thinking too. In a trance, the disciple was already sleeping on his feet. Ou Meng Garden every day there are pedestrians stop and go, there is moonlight, there is gravel. It's just that there are more people like me and my beloved."

For a long time, the "Fairy boat Alliance" has landed in countless worlds that have been stopped by the gods, and will wipe out all the undead evil things, and any star race that prudes for abundant grace has to consider the threat of fairy boat destroyer. And this is exactly what the "Fairy Boat Alliance" seeks to deter, they want to incarnate as a constant alarm bell, become all greedy people can not pay the price. To this day, different creatures have gathered together in Xianzhou, all in order to retaliate against the wanton "abundance" and thoroughly implement the "will of hunting."

These four people, dead or alive; The "slaves of fate" must not be harmed or deprived of the ability to think for themselves. At some silent moment, the "cancer of all worlds" ripples in the vast sea of stars like a stone thrown into the water. In a very short time, these twisted and obscure substances have turned over the boundaries, and with the mud are the gems of the sunlit starlet, that is, the stars' nuclei; Wherever the core goes, it leaves behind destruction and destruction; For the various afflicted civilizations, the core was a symbol of destruction; Even so, there are people in the sea of stars who seek pearls in muddy water, they call themselves "star core hunters", in order to seize the star core and shuttle between different worlds; Apart from their deeds, nothing is known about the Starcore Hunters:what kind of star god do they believe in, and what do they want to take the star core? ... There is only one thing that the universe can agree on:there are very few Starcore Hunters, but all of them are good."
Belobog_start_screen_messages:0 "Thousands of years ago, Yalilo-VI had a springlike climate and an enviable Marine environment. The woods are full of fruit, the tide brings moist warmth, wine like a spring can be picked up, everyone drinks. The enterprising and energetic inhabitants built roads, cities, seaside villas and fine palaces. Rich and nourishing life always seems to start with a cup of coffee at dawn and end with a cup of malt at dusk. The orbit then connected the world of Yaliro-VI, bringing interplanetary trade and extraterrestrial technology. At first, visitors from other worlds came in search of the earth's pulp, the crystal clear mineral that holds the blood that drives industry, the amber reflection reflecting the preserved brilliance; Later, visitors from other lands came for a long and peaceful life, and its bays, palm trees, and lilting music were suitable for any weary traveler seeking a home - it was believed that in time, this humid planet would shine like any other shining star in the Milky Way. About a thousand years ago, a star core streaked across the sky and fell into the world. Then the fate of the entire planet spiraled into a grotesque farce. The fierce Army of Doom fell from the sky, and the monstrous war broke out one after another. The builders put up walls and battle lines, the hundred-meter statues rose and wrestled with the dragons -- and then suddenly, without warning, a cold wave appeared, a fierce storm engulfed everything, and the whole planet was silent... The great invisible barrier of space covers the fortress city like a candle flame held in its arms on a cold night, so civilization continues. Later, the city became known as Belloberg."
