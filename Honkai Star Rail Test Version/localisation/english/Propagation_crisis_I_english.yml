crisis.30.i:0 "What does "Prethoryn" mean?"
crisis.51.desc:0 "Some kind of militant order dedicated towards fighting the Propagation has surfaced in the galaxy. Their membership seems to be made up primarily of the dispossessed and downtrodden - refugees, war veterans and others who have lost everything to the onslaught of the Scourge.\n\nDespite this, their ramshackle fleets have somehow managed to win several engagements against Propagation hunter-killer swarms. There are unconfirmed reports that their fleets include starships of unusual design..."
crisis.52.desc:0 "We are the Sentinels. Our order has sworn to halt the murderous rampage of the Propagation no matter the cost. Where other empires crumble, we stand firm. Where they abandon their own to the Scourge, we give them the means to fight back.\n\nI am Grand Master Korgas, the first of our order. Do not be deceived by my appearance - Sentinels are recruited from all species in the galaxy, including yours. We ask only that your government keep up the fight against the Propagation and support our Sentinels where possible."
crisis.52.a.response:0 "Many Sentinels have military backgrounds. We are survivors from a dozen different fleets that fought the Propagation and lost. As Sentinels, we have learned from the mistakes of the past and work hard never to repeat them.\n\nAlso, I believe I mentioned that we recruit from all species in the galaxy. This includes the elder races, such as the [sentinel_fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We have the support of several influential factions within the §H[sentinel_fallen_empire.GetName]§! who have no wish to see their galaxy devoured. They have donated both ships and resources to our cause."
crisis.55.desc_01:0 "Our galaxy is faced with two possible futures: either the Propagation Scourge consumes all organic life and moves on, or they are destroyed to the last of their despicable kind."
crisis.55.desc_05:0 "If you lack the means to fight the Scourge directly, you are more than welcome to donate resources to us. This will let us throw additional forces against the Propagation invaders."
crisis.55.a:0 "What can you tell us about the Prethoryn?"
crisis.55.a.response:0 "Alas, we don't know as much as we would like, but they are clearly extragalactic in origin. It is possible that they have devoured dozens or even hundreds of other galaxies before they reached ours... or we could be the first victims beyond their own home galaxy.\n\nAfter they have finished consuming all non-Propagation life on a planet, they terraform it into what can only be described as a twisted nightmare. These Infested Worlds are hostile to all other forms of life, and the only way to cleanse the infestation is to burn away the entire biosphere with intense orbital bombardment."
crisis.71.desc:0 "The Sentinels have taken note of your valiant struggle against the Propagation Scourge. Since the fleet commanders of the [Root.GetName] clearly know how to win battles, we would like to permanently transfer one of our battle fleets over to your control. We currently lack the manpower to effectively crew these vessels, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.\n\nYou must solemnly promise to only use these warships against the Scourge, however!"
crisis.71.b.response:0 "We understand. Then we ask only that you keep up the fight, friends. Every wretched Propagation that you blow out of the stars is a victory for the entire galaxy."
crisis.101.desc:0 "A deep space spy drone has stumbled upon the site of what appears to have been a recent space battle between the Propagation and a second, as yet unidentified, party in the [queen_system.GetName] system. A Propagation Queen was badly injured in the fighting, and seems to have been left for dead.\n\nThe spy drone has reported that the creature is still alive, however. This could be a priceless opportunity to capture the Queen alive."
crisis.105.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has managed to heal the worst of the Propagation Queen's injuries. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] removed the organ responsible for the creature's subspace connection with the rest of the Scourge, and replaced it with a small positronic implant that gives us control over it.\n\nWe can now order the Queen around, and it has already started breeding new Propagation creatures that are loyal to it, and thus, by extension, us. As long as we can keep the Queen alive, we should be able to grow a fleet of domesticated Propagation creatures!"
crisis.107.desc:0 "Someone else has captured the injured Propagation Queen that was discovered in the [queen_system_1.GetName] system! The creature has not only been fully healed, but its connection to the rest of the Scourge has been severed. It now serves its new masters, and reports suggest that it has already started a new brood."
crisis.211.desc:0 "The galaxy breathed a collective sigh of relief today, as the last significant pockets of the Propagation Scourge were expunged. Their extragalactic invasion has failed, and all that remains of the Prethoryn's once colossal swarm are the innumerable charred husks that now drift quietly through the void.\n\nA sense of elation and utter joy is spreading across the galaxy at a speed greater than light, and spontaneous victory celebrations have erupted on countless worlds. Could this be the beginning of a new age of galactic peace and stability?"
crisis.234.desc:0 "Over the last few months, the Propagation Queen we captured has appeared increasingly restless and uneasy. At first, we thought it was simply missing its connection with the rest of its kind, until our Telepaths told us that it had been in communication with them, speaking of a 'Hole in the Void'.\n\nWhat it meant by this we found out only when a team of scientists researching Propagation intergalactic travel methods discovered a discrepancy in our astronomical database. While charting the likely path the Propagation had been following, they found that a small spiral galaxy some 30 million light-years distant from our own was... missing.\n\nThe galaxy, discovered and studied during the early space era of our species, is simply no longer emanating any form of light observable by our instruments. This bizarre and unexpected discovery sent our scientists into a scramble to try and explain what could cause an entire galaxy to simply vanish from the sky.\n\nTwo explanations emerged: Either the stars of the galaxy simply went out, all at once, or there is something, something so vast as to eclipse an entire galaxy, blocking its light from reaching us. Both theories seem equally implausible, and many have simply decried them as ludicrous, preferring to think that the missing galaxy never existed at all, invented by some erroneous use of a primitive telescope. Nonetheless, a palpable sense of dread and foreboding surrounds the whole incident..."

Our sole purpose was to see to the defeat of the Scourge, and now that this has been accomplished, it is time for our members to go their separate ways. To prevent their misuse, our surviving battle fleets will be dismantled.\n\nMay the defeat of this intergalactic menace herald a new era of peace. This is Sentinel One, signing off."
crisis.78.desc:0 "This is Sentinel One. These are truly desperate times for the galaxy, but I am here to bring you some good news.\n\nThrough extensive combat experience and painstaking research, Sentinel agents have compiled extremely detailed anatomy files on the creatures of the Propagation Scourge. For example, did you know that Propagation Swarmlings have been known to violently combust if both their primary and secondary gallbladders are punctured at the same time?\n\nWe are making these files available to everyone in the galaxy. By targeting the weaknesses we have found, you should find that your fleets are much more effective in battle against the Scourge."

crisis.121.desc:0 "Many Propagation creatures remain unaccounted for after the defeat of the Scourge, having slipped away into the depths of space in the ensuing chaos. With no central hive consciousness to guide them, most of these mindless beasts will eventually wither and perish.\n\nHowever, recent sightings have confirmed that a large number of these feral Propagation have established a new lair in the §H[feral_prethoryn_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nIn the coming years, we will likely face the possibility of more feral Propagation nesting in unoccupied systems where the Scourge once had a presence. They are unlikely to develop into a major threat - these wild creatures are prone to infighting and do not exhibit the calculating intelligence that drove the Scourge onwards."
