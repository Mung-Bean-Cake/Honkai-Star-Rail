Dvalin_General: "Dvalin"
 Dvalin_General_desc: "In the long years and infinite darkness, even clear gems can become dusty and dull, and proud dragons can be corrupted and filled with wrath. Remember, however, that dust can be easily wiped away, and doubts and poison can be crushed. This is the admonition of a friend of mine, though I have always felt that he does not do the right thing and does not seem like a wise man. But without him, I might not be where I am today. He wrote this verse: Be free to soar through deep space. As when you and I met, I walked the earth and sang the songs of the wind; you were high in the sky where the atmosphere was thin, overlooking the world. It would be beautiful today when the sky is free of wind and snow and the earth is filled with green grass. If you too had walked on the ground, heard the pastoral songs and the wind chimes staggering in the distance, and tasted the wine as sweet as honey you would understand, wouldn't you. If only you had been me, seen your lonely look as you glided across the blue sky, and seen your beautiful body. In that case, you would understand that such a sky and earth are worth fighting for. However, it is all gone, and he is no more."

DOT_SR_Dvalin.001.name: "Dvalin"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.001.desc: "My name is Tvalin, and I come from a lost realm that the beings of my homeland call Tivat. I was originally one of the 'Guardians of the Four Winds' in the region of Tewatmund, guarding the world according to an old agreement. For this reason, I was called the Dragon of the East Wind. However, when disaster struck, everything came to an end. Who knew that for millions of miles in Mundo, there would be beautiful scenery everywhere. Flowers and plants that do not fail in four seasons, trees that are evergreen in eight seasons. A taste of tea, five-colored melons, and flowers in all seasons. The warmth of the ground and the color of the mountains make Yan a good home, and the spring in the northern part of the water is priceless."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.001.a: "Welcome Tvalin"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.001.b: "You are not welcome here."

Remember, however, that dust can be easily wiped away, and doubts and poison can be crushed. This is the admonition of a friend of mine, though I have always felt that he does not do the right thing and does not seem like a wise man. But without him, I might not be where I am today.

 DOT_SR_Dvalin.002.a: "Good."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.002.b: "Goodbye"
 
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.003.name: "Dvalin"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.003.desc: "My friend, I know you are curious about my past. I feel that I should also tell you the story of Tivat and Mond, so that the universe does not forget this lost history. "Repeating the white events of eternity, the poet rises in song." "In those days, the gods lived on earth, and the world of men has been a few years in the past." After finishing the story of the ruins, the story of Winnetouch, the poet began to tell the story of the wind dragon. He recited, "The story I tell comes from the ancient times, when the gods still walked the earthly world." It was at that time, about five thousand years ago, that the dragon carrying the element of wind was born in the high heavens. He descended slowly, curious about the world. He landed in a village, but was struck by stones thrown by the fearful people. The dragon could not understand the words the people spoke in their fear. He landed in the cemetery and only heard the lamentations of the sad people. The dragon could not understand the words spoken in sorrow. He landed in an orchard and was cursed by the angry people who had lost their fruit trees. The dragon did not understand the words spoken by the people in anger. The world was too complicated. The dragon was confused, but the dragon still wanted to try. Until one day, the dragon heard the sound of the lyre of the sky. "Sky" was the name of the Lyra lyre, the companion of the God of Wind. The dragon was drawn to the verse and landed next to the best singer under the sky. People began to panic, for the mighty dragons of the elements and the great gods who dominate the earthly world have always had trouble getting along. "Behold, how beautiful and gentle it is." The Wind Singer said. "But we don't know what it's thinking." The people said. The melody and the poetry attracted the dragon and the people, what kind of magic was this? The dragon decided to stay with the singer, for it too wanted everything to understand its heart. It learned the words of the people and the techniques of the Songwriter of the Winds. The "Wolf" of the Knights of the North Wind, the "Lion" of the Knights of the Dandelion, the "Eagle" of the Order of the West Wind, and Tvalin - the "Wind Dragon" - were thus seen as Mond's "Guardian of the Four Winds."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.003.a: "Okay."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.003.b: "Bye"

 DOT_SR_Dvalin.004.b: "See you later"
 
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.005.name: "Dvalin"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.005.desc: "Ancient nations darken at sunset, pearls lose their light. Gold loses its color, white silk is dyed yellow." That's another story that took place in the underground lost kingdom of Kanria. About 3,000 years ago, the entire continent experienced a time of chaos. The forces of darkness spread and marched, contaminating everything they encountered. During that time barbarians grew and magical beasts raged on the land. People's living space was compressed within city walls, and the wilderness was full of danger. It was a particularly grueling time for Mond. The legacy of the Lion Tooth Knights was vacant due to no one holding the qualification, and the West Wind Knights also lost their talents due to the grueling battles. At this time, the Black Sun Dynasty was overthrown, and disaster broke through the walls of the ancient kingdom and spread across the continent. The alchemists known as "Gold" degenerated into sinners and bred a large number of pitch-black magical beasts. The blackened serpent, the Evil Dragon, "Durin" rose from the sea, and shadows loomed over Mund. But at this time, there was a gap in the legacy of the Knights of the Lion's Tooth, and the eagle flag of the Knights of the West Wind could not be flown in the wind. The continuous complaints finally called out the God of Mond, the Wind Singer, once again. The prayers of the people of Mond finally awakened the will of the wind god, and the sky lyre was played again, and the wind dragon was summoned again. Now Mond has only the Wind Dragon to rely on. The dragon and the wind dragon fought to the death in the stormy wind. The Wind Dragon finally wins, biting the Dragon's throat, but swallowing the poisonous blood. The poisonous blood of the evil dragon was the very power of the distorted gold that made the mountains crumble and the earth break down. The wind dragon guarded Mund, and he thought that this way people would understand it, I guess. And so it fell into a long sleep. The Sky Lyre played a mournful tune. The next time you wake up, you should be free, said the Sky Lyre. The dragon that should have been free to fly in the high heavens, all things will finally understand your beauty."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.005.a: "Yes."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.005.b: "Goodbye"

 DOT_SR_Dvalin.006.name: "Dvalin"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.006.desc: "However, things do not go as one wishes. Durin's corpse was embedded in the cold and snow, and Tvalin was recalled by the wind gods and fell into a deep sleep. It was once believed that the wind dragons would awaken in times of need and guard Mund. But in times of peace, the belief in the guardianship of the four winds was lost and the corresponding temples abandoned. Five hundred years later, Tevarin was lost and corrupted under the influence of poisoned blood and abyssal mages. Upon reawakening, it did not hear the sound of its friend's lyre, but the whispers of the Abyssal Mage. It cursed its host for not being there for it in the most critical moments. Tvalin gradually transformed into a magic dragon instead of the wind dragon he once was. It even fell to the point where it was besieged by the Knights. When the world finally realized that the strange and harmful beast "Dvalin", which had fought with the Knights several times, was the Tvalin of the Four Wind Guardians, the hate-driven antagonism had already formed and could not be reconciled. Awakened after a hundred years, it can no doubt only feel the city's betrayal of it. Fortunately, with the help of a traveler from a foreign land, Tevarin was saved. The wind is going to shift. One day, it will blow in a more luminous direction. Ah, all is well."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.006.a: "Good."

I stood between heaven and earth, seeing my civilization destroyed and my family and friends gone, so I had to flee alone and go into exile in the Great Void. A thousand years later, I realized that the culprit of the past disaster was called the Star River Hunter! Who knows that the ten million miles of Monde, everywhere good scenery. Four seasons of undefeated flowers and plants, eight sections of evergreen trees. A taste of tea, five-colored melons, flowers in all seasons. The earth is warm and the mountains are cold and the swallows are good for home, and the people are idle and the water is north and the spring is priceless."
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.007.a: "We want you to join our civilization, and we're willing to help you get your revenge!"
 DOT_SR_Dvalin.007.b: "The story is over, goodbye my friend!"
