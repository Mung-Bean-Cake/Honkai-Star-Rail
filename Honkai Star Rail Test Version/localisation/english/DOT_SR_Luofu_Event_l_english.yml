 DOT_SR_Luofu.001.desc:0 "I was wandering around the Exalting Sanctum today, and I saw a foreign Balladian peddling along the street. I went up and found out they were selling pets.\n\nThe animal I saw looked like a house cat, but its body was much smaller. It was lying down on a mat in a bamboo cage, purring and meowing affectionately. However, after the Ambrosial Arbor took root, most of the Xianzhou people preferred large and strong pets. I asked the Balladian why this animal was so small, and if anyone had shown interest in buying it.\n\nThe person responded that it is true that Xianzhou people like large and strong pets, but there are also those who love petite and delicate ones. Now that he saw the sparkle in my eyes, he expected that I must be the latter. Perhaps it was fate? I couldn't refuse.\n\nThe person also said that this small animal is called a grimalkin, and it was one of the species that the ancestors of Xianzhou loved to keep during the Primeval Imperium Era. Today, the strong Xianzhou house cat evolved from this small grimalkin. This was in line with what I'd read in old texts. However, the grimalkin had been extinct for many years. This made me suspicious, and I inquired about its origin.\n\nThe person swore to me that though grimalkins were extinct in Xianzhou, they were bred on many other planets. This animal is truly just an ordinary white grimalkin. It was neither genetically modified, nor was it an invasive species, so I could rest assured.\n\nHow could I turn down looking after a long-extinct little animal to help continue its lineage — especially after petting those tender little paws?\n\nEventually, I paid hefty sum for the grimalkin, named it \"Mimi,\" and took it home. Only that I'm too busy with official business and have little time to take care of Mimi. After thinking it over, chores like feeding it and changing its water should also be entrusted to Qingzu."

 DOT_SR_Luofu.002.desc:0 "Mimi is getting bigger and bigger, and becoming more and more attached. It's also very intelligent. Mimi's soft, snow-like fur flows like the clouds, and its nine ridged tail has a big ball of fuzz at the end. Mimi's round, full, and blue irises possess radiating patterns like cracks over ice. Their colors are rich, charming, and dignified.\n\nHowever, Mimi's appetite is strangely large. Is it really a grimalkin? I thought to myself that the name \"Mimi\" might not be too appropriate at this point.\n\nQingzu told me the other day that she had purchased 200 catties worth of meat for the Seat of Divine Foresight's meals in the past week, but Mimi wiped it all clean. The story did not end there. She also said that this has become the gossip of the town, and the rumors have it that the general has been neglecting his duties and indulging in gluttony instead. This has gotten the people all riled up.\n\nQingzu was worried that could be bad for me, but I didn't think too much of it and told her not to worry. In my opinion, \"The Glutton General\" sounds more impressive than \"The Dozing General.\""

 DOT_SR_Luofu.003.desc:0 "The food expenses are gradually becoming unsustainable. I thought that there must be some way to deal with this, so I brought in a healer from the Alchemy Commission to check on Wave-Treading Snow Lion (sorry, Qingzu, I'm horrible at naming). The healer's consultation was fruitless, instead suggesting we try some genetic testing. I agreed. The results were in line with its food intake — as expected, it was not a grimalkin after all, let alone an ordinary house cat.\n\nIt was a lion. Hence the name change to from Mimi to Wave-Treading Snow Lion.\n\nHowever, this fact did not affect its usual grimalkin-like behavior. Whenever Snow Lion is free (it usually is), it either scratches the silk curtains or rips the felt, or engorges itself on its specially-prepared schizonepeta. Of course, Qingzu's effort can't be overstated. She's really trained it well, but sometimes it unfortunately gets in the way of official business.\n\nAll that aside, the top priority now should be to find ways to reduce the food expenditure. I'm afraid this will take some time to figure it out."

 DOT_SR_Luofu.004.name:0 "The Judge of Ten Lords-Commission"
 DOT_SR_Luofu.004.desc:0 "Elixir Research Terrace is where elixirs are researched under the auspices of the Alchemy Commission. A man storms wildly across the pointed rooftop rafters.\n\nWithin but a moment, the man is at the edge of the eaves with nothing but air beneath his steps. Suddenly, the man leaps off the roof, catching onto a Heron Express cycrane. The birdlike ingenuity mutters out a few prerecorded warnings before trying to shake him off. Finally, it stabilizes, and carries him off safely to a starskiff parked in the distance.\n\nWhen the Alchemy Commission guards finally reached the rooftop, the man had disappeared — leaving behind only a cricket-like shadow figure.\n\nA guard eyed the diminishing figure, before falling to the ground with tears in his eyes, trembling as he muttered: \"It's over, everything's over.\"\n\n\"Ninsa, it's not our fault.\" The officer beside him sighed aloud and then spoke self-deprecatingly, \"Notify the Ten-Lords Commission. They can fix this.\"\n\n\"Fix?\" Shouted the guard called Ninsa. \"Tell me how to fix this, Hede. He fled with a jade abacus that holds the prescriptions from the Theophany Era! Xianzhou has been hiding those secrets for centuries. Once revealed, the consequences will be unimaginable...\"\n\nNinsa paused and, seeing his partner lost for words and his own troops even more petrified, he stood up to continue shouting: \"We didn't even get a clear view of his face! Even the Ten-Lords Commission can't help us.\"\n\nBefore he could finish, a cold female voice rang out behind everyone: \"I've already memorized his face. Rest assured.\"\n\nEveryone automatically fanned out, and the woman revealed her face — a young girl with short black hair holding a chain and scepter in her hands. There was no emotion on her delicate and lovely face, and it sent chills down the spines of the troops.\n\n\"All ingenium creations are prohibited around the Elixir Research Terrace. Of course, not including me.\"\n\nThe young lady said as she walked to the edge of the roof, her voice chilling to the bones. \"All cycranes responsible for deliveries are registered with the Realm-Keeping Commission. If they were modded, they can be detected very soon.\"\n\n\"How do you explain that particular one? You've seen it, right?\" Asked Ninsa.\n\n\"It may have been hijacked by some kind of bioelectric signal. That Outworlder's abilities are pretty unique, are you concerned?\"\n\nNinsa seems to be stunned into silence by this visitor, and almost dropped to the ground once more. Like an animal with his instincts, Hede asked cautiously, \"May I ask who your Excellency is...\"\n\n\"Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission.\"\n\nAnd with that, the girl flipped down off the top of the roof, and instantly disappeared out of sight."

 DOT_SR_Luofu.005.name:0 "Sources of secret prescriptions' information"
 DOT_SR_Luofu.005.desc:0 "Continuing: A prescription of ages past containing the secrets to longevity was stolen. Like a porcelain doll, the girl from the Ten-Lords Commission gave chase. She had to catch up before the secret was leaked, to apprehend the criminal...\n\n\"Hey, Madam,\" called out a short Foxian female judge. \"Not even the Ten-Lords Commission could identify bioelectric signals without any evidence. This judgment seems a little arbitrary...\"\n\n\"The point is not the signal itself,\" the girl being called Madam interrupted. \"A secret prescription from the Theophany Era is hidden in the Elixir Research Terrace, and was stolen by an Outworld thief...\"\n\n\"What do you mean...?\" asked the Foxian tentatively, afraid of being remonstrated by her leader for not knowing.\n\n\"Has all items stored in the Elixir Research Terrace been advertised so widely that even Outworlders know about it? Has it become common knowledge?\" said the girl, pausing to add: \"Go and look into things there, including any previous doctors who've been fired or quit.\"\n\n\n\"Miss, please stop. This is the men's room...\"\n\nBefore he could finish, the Vidyadhara guy guarding the door of the men's room felt a cold object on his neck. Looking down, he saw a scepter in the shape of a spear-tip.\n\nAccording to his own words, he was able to safely survive his first 300 years by relying on three words alone: \"understand the times.\" So he immediately smiled and said: \"It's urgent, right? Then I won't stop you, haha.\"\n\nThen, he cut a strange pose, turned back, and smiled apologetically as he fled off down a dark alleyway.\n\nThe dark-haired girl used her scepter to lift up the filthy doorway curtain of the toilet and walked inside.\n\nBehind the curtain, a strong stench stimulated her olfactory center. A quick analysis was completed within a nanosecond: It was not the smell of ammonia, but a pungent odor of sodium hypochlorite. Perhaps the vast majority of law-abiding citizens of Xianzhou would never imagine an apothecary hiding out in an abandoned public toilet like this.\n\nIn the darkest depths of this \"apothecary,\" there's a man looking like a healer in a daze. Before he could react, the girl closed in on him with her ghastly form. A chain slithered up like a living being and encoiled him. At the same time, the sharp point of the scepter was pressed against his throat.\n\n\"Who did you tell about the secret prescriptions kept in the Elixir Research Terrace?\" the girl hissed, slightly releasing pressure so that he could speak.\n\n\"Prescription... I don't know about any prescription... Ugh...\"\n\nHe only manages to say a few words before the girl tightens her grip, blocking up the words in his throat.\n\n\"Who is he?\" she demanded, again relaxing her right hand slightly.\n\n\"Ahem... I don't know... Ugh...\"\n\n\"How many of the Ten Lords' interrogation methods have you heard of? I'll ask you one last time: Who is he?\" She retracted the spear-like scepter and in a display of strength disproportionate to her size, lifted him up entirely off the ground.\n\n\"Ahem... Coventry! Ahem... Albert Coventry! There, I said it! I told you. Please spare me!\"\n\nThe man suddenly felt all his strength had left his body. Both legs gave way as he collapsed to the ground. When he came back around and tried to see the girl's face, he realized that the entire nightmare interrogation process was as though it never existed — only the rustling sound from the alleyway remained.\n"

 DOT_SR_Luofu.006.name:0 "Ten Lords' Verdict"
 DOT_SR_Luofu.006.desc:0 "Continuing: When a crime is committed, the judge must bring down the gavel. In terms of the result, what value is a secret if nobody knows it? As long as it's still a secret, its true form is not important at all...\n\nThe girl opened the scroll she was carrying and looked thoughtfully at the real-time data refreshing on the map.\n\n\"The intel Coventry obtained is not the prescription. Is that what you mean?\" asked the Foxian judge meekly.\n\n\"The prescription is just a front.\" said the girl, without looking up.\n\n\"So... as far as I am concerned, Coventry is just being used. Some people in the Elixir Research Terrace wanted to stir up chaos to muddle the news of their research. The news of theft is just a ploy for redirection.\" the Foxian said, sending across several notes to the scroll in the girl's hand. \"I've already got the diviner who is able to recover the data presumed lost.\"\n\n\"Well done.\" The girl nodded, her tone still ice-cold.\n\nWhen the Foxian judge heard this cold praise, she tried her best to maintain a serious expression but her ears couldn't help wiggling.\n\n\nAbout three hours later after confirming nobody was following him, Coventry opened the door and called out: \"I'm back.\"\n\nAs soon as he opened the door, he felt something was off. The room was completely dark. That crazed Xianzhou hacker Mishang used to welcome him back by singing a strange ditty, but this time the room was dead silent.\n\n\"Something is wrong,\" he quietly said to himself as he pulled out his weapon. He pushed on into the darkness.\n\nBehind the screen that sectioned the room, a white figure emerged slowly. Coventry almost reflexively pulled the trigger of his hand crossbow.\n\nA two-inch-long, thin, cyan-colored bolt thrummed, hovering about a foot in front of the delicate face of the young girl. The bolthead crackled with sparks as if trying to break through the invisible barrier.\n\n\"H—How did you find me?\"\n\n\"Cycrane.\" The response was a cold and emotionless female voice.\n\n\"That drone? I released it as soon as I landed!\" cried the man nonchalantly.\n\n\"The influenced cycrane has been retrieved by the Realm-Keeping Commission. Its flight path was enough for the Divination Commission to triangulate your whereabouts.\" The girl half-curiously touched the quivering bolthead in the air like teasing a butterfly.\n\nThis was the moment Coventry was waiting for, the split-second window of opportunity for his escape.\n\nHe bent his knees and pushed off with the soles of his feet. A purple electrical arc could be seen in the center of his palms. Coventry roamed many worlds and had always fluttered outside the grasp of the Interastral Peace Corporation. He was perpetually on the wanted list, not just because of his well-planned schemes, but also because he knew what to do when he was caught.\n\nUnder his artificial skin, a network of electrical pulses was implanted, Coventry rarely showed this trick up his sleeves to anyone. Whether it be the long-life species of Xianzhou or the Artisanship Commission's Ingenium creations... With a fully powered strike, they would likely all turn to ashes.\n\n\"Electromagnetic field activate!\"\n\n\"Gotcha!\" The man felt his enemy in his palm. If it wasn't for the need to concentrate all his attention on maintaining the electrical output, he would have laughed out loud.\n\nSmoke rose and sparks flew as the unpleasant smell of burning filled the area.\n\nCoventry trembled as if having an epileptic seizure as he struggled to control himself. Upon impact, the pitch-black room spun into a blob of shadow in his unimaginable defeat.\n\n\"Your movement is too slow.\" The young girl materialized from within the shadow.\n\nM—Movement? Coventry stared at his wrist, bent at an unnatural angle. At some point in time unbeknownst to him, that hand was forcibly pressed against his lower jaw.\n\n\"Using electricity without being insulated. What a useless maneuver.\"\n\nThe judge in white showed no emotions on her face.\n\n\"Involuntary Immortalization and Immortality Theft. These two are the gravest of the Ten Unpardonable Sins. Do you admit your guilt?\"\n\nThe man could not control his shaking, partially because of the electric shock, but more because of the fear.\n\nWith the remaining sanity he could muster, he begged with his coarse voice, \"Please... Please forgive me. I haven't even peeked at the prescription. I will leave it behind and get my butt off of the Luofu. Please... You will never see me again!\"\n\nCoventry steeled his nerves, awaiting the verdict from the judge — but there was only silence in the darkness. After a long while, he seemed to hear an impossible sneering from out of the darkness.\n\nImmediately after, that same cold voice rang out again and in a sacred, firm, and undeniable tone said word-by-word:\n\n\"Ten Lords' Verdict.\""
